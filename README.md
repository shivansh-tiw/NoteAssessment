**Project Overview:**

This project consists of two microservices, UserAuthentication and Note, designed to provide secure user authentication and note management functionalities. The microservices are built using the Spring Boot framework, and user data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.

**Key Features:**

* UserAuthentication microservice: Allows users to register and obtain access tokens for secure authentication.  
* Note microservice: Provides RESTful API endpoints for creating, updating, and managing user-specific notes.

**Technology Stack:**

* Spring Boot  
* PostgreSQL  
* JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication

**Instructions for Running the Project:**

* Clone the repository.  
* Set up the PostgreSQL database and configure the application.properties files.  
* Run the UserAuthentication microservice on port 8080 and the Note microservice on port 8081.  

**Future Development Plans:**

* Enhance security measures, such as implementing HTTPS.  
* Add support for user roles and permissions.  
* Improve scalability for handling larger user bases.
